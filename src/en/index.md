For a year, the bus will go on French roads meeting teenagers during weekly stops in towns. When the user gets into the bus, he discovers an immersive eight workshops pathway. However, this is not just a simple interactive exhibit. In order to give a more personal dimension to the experience and answer as best as possible to the user's apprehensions, we customize the workshops according to the informations he gave us. Because we do not all have the same apprehensions when it comes to sex.
